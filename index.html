            <p class="lead">Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein. Calm down, Marty, I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact. Where the hell are they. The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler. I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at exactly 1:21 a.m. we should cat h up with him and the time machine. Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of the Delorean?The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car why not do it with some style. Besides, the stainless, steel construction made the flux dispersal- look out! (he shoves Marty out of the way just as the car reappears. It's covered in ice.)Wait a minute, where are you going now? To intercept the real Marty Junior, you're taking his place. Round the corner at the Café 80's, guy named Griff, just say no! Hey, what about Jennifer? We're not just gonna leave her here? Don't worry, she'll be safe, it'll just be for a few minutes. (Marty starts to walk off towards Café 80’s) Marty, be careful around that Griff character. (Doc puts his finger up to his head and makes a "he's loopy" sign as he says this.) He's got a few short circuits in his bionic implants. (Courthouse Square)Use this document as a way to quickly start any new project.<br> All you get is this text and a mostly barebones HTML document.<br> (The whistle blows as the train finally leaves the station. The bearded man from last night is sitting next to another man directly behind Clara, who is sitting alone.) Yessir, that poor fella last night had the biggest case of broken heart I have ever seen! And when he said that he didn't know how he could live the rest of his life knowing how much hurt he'd caused that little girl? Well, I really felt for him. I did. Right here. (Saloon - Back Room) (Marty is crouched low as he looks out the window. Tannen now has Doc as a hostage.) Listen up, Eastwood! I intend to shoot somebody today and I'd prefer it to be you. But if you're just too damn yella, I guess it'll just have to be you're blacksmith friend.hhhhhhhskadhblkbf </p>
